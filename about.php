          <h1>WHAT IS IMPROVE ?</h1>
          <p>Is this a council website? No, it isn't – but Improve does send your reports direct to your local council.
              We also publish them online, so that others in the community can read, discuss, and offer advice where needed.
              Then who are you? And why are you doing this?
              Improve is an independent website, built by the charity mySociety. We wanted to make it easier to report problems in your community, even if you don't know who those reports should go to.
              So we made Improve. All you have to do is type in a postcode – or let the site locate you automatically – and describe your problem. Then we send your report to the people whose job it is to fix it.
              Improve covers the whole of the UK. No matter where you are, the only thing you ever have to remember is our web address – Improve.com.
              Do councils read or act on Improve reports?
              They certainly do. Reports sent through Improve go into the same council email inboxes as reports sent through by any other means.
              Really smart councils integrate directly, so we can place report details directly into their systems, saving them time and money.
              How can I contact you?
              You can use this form – but please see whether these FAQs answer your question first, because that saves your time and ours.
              Is there a Improve app?
              Yes – there's an app for iOS and an Android app. A volunteer has also written an Nokia Ovi app.
              If your phone isn't supported, try accessing Improve via your mobile browser – it should work well.
